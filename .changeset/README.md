# Changesets

We use Changesets to version workspace packages and generate release notes.

Common commands:
- `pnpm changeset` — create a new changeset.
- `pnpm changeset version` — apply pending changesets to bump versions/changelog.
- `pnpm changeset publish` — publish (if/when packages become public).
